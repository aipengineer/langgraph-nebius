Unit 1: Graph Basics & State Management
Exercise 1.2 - "Message Memory"

Objective:
Extend Exercise 1.1 to create a more sophisticated conversation manager that:
1. Maintains a sliding window of recent messages
2. Generates summaries of longer conversations
3. Includes metadata with messages
4. Follows the same conversation flow (Hello -> How are you? -> Goodbye)

Requirements:
1. State Management:
   - Extend the State type to include summary and window_size
   - Track message metadata (timestamps, roles)
   - Maintain conversation history with sliding window

2. Node Implementation:
   - llm_response: Generate appropriate responses with metadata
   - message_windowing: Implement sliding window logic
   - summary_generation: Create summaries for longer conversations
   - should_end: Determine when to end the conversation

3. Graph Structure:
   - Create a pipeline of nodes for message processing
   - Implement proper conversation ending condition
   - Connect nodes in the correct order

# 4. Decide whether to continue or end
