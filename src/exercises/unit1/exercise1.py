Unit 1: Graph Basics & State Management
Exercise 1.1 - "Hello LangGraph"

Objective:
Create a simple conversational graph that follows a fixed pattern:
1. Start with "Hello!"
2. Respond with "How are you?"
3. End with "Goodbye!"

Requirements:
1. State Management:
   - Use TypedDict to define a State type with a messages field
   - Use Annotated and add_messages for proper message handling

2. Node Implementation:
   - Create a single LLM node that manages the conversation flow
   - Handle the empty initial state case
   - Process each message to determine the next response
   - Return appropriate state updates

3. Graph Structure:
   - Initialize a StateGraph with the proper State type
   - Add the LLM node and necessary edges
   - Implement proper conversation ending condition
   - Use START and END appropriately

4. Expected Behavior:
   - Should support a 3-message conversation
   - Must properly terminate after "Goodbye!"
   - Should handle the initial empty state
