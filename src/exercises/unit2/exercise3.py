UNIT 2: Building Agents with LangGraph
Exercise 2.3 - "Parallel Tool Executor with Fan-out/Fan-in"
### Implementation Steps

1. **State Management**
   - Complete the `State` class with proper annotations
   - Implement the `dict_reducer` function
   - Create the `mock_tool` implementation

2. **State Initialization**
   - Implement `get_initial_state` to handle both mock and real tools
   - Complete `init_state` to properly initialize state

3. **Tool Execution**
   - Implement `execute_tool` to handle both mock and real tools
   - Add proper error handling

4. **Parallel Execution**
   - Complete `parallel_executor` to run tools concurrently
   - Maintain state properly during execution

5. **Result Handling**
   - Implement `result_aggregator` to combine results
   - Create `error_handler` for error cases
   - Complete `route_results` for proper routing

6. **Graph Configuration**
   - Add all necessary nodes
   - Configure proper edges
   - Set up conditional routing

### Testing Your Implementation

Your solution should pass the following test scenarios:
1. Empty state initialization
2. Tool execution success and failure
3. Parallel execution with multiple tools
4. Result aggregation and error handling
5. Complete graph execution

### Requirements
- Must maintain state properly throughout execution
- Must handle both mock and real tools
- Must execute tools in parallel when possible
- Must properly aggregate results and handle errors
- Must follow LangGraph patterns for state management

### Tips
- Use the `async/await` pattern for tool execution
- Preserve existing state when updating
- Properly handle message accumulation
- Consider edge cases in routing
- Test with both empty and full states

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code completeness and correctness
- Error handling robustness
- Proper state management
- Test coverage
- Code organization and clarity

## Example Usage
```python
# Initialize with mock tools
state = get_initial_state(use_mock=True)
result = await graph.ainvoke(state)
print(result)

# Initialize with real tools
state = get_initial_state(use_mock=False)
result = await graph.ainvoke(state)
print(result)
