Additional Notes:

State Management: The state is the core of a LangGraph application, holding all the data that flows through the graph.  It's typically a dictionary or a TypedDict for type safety.   
Nodes: Nodes are the building blocks of a LangGraph application, representing individual actions or steps in a workflow.  They can be simple functions or complex chains of operations.   
Edges: Edges define the flow of execution in a LangGraph application, connecting nodes and determining the order in which they are executed.    
Message Handling: LangChain messages are used to represent user inputs and agent responses in a structured way.  The add_messages function helps manage these messages in the graph's state.   
Conditional Flow: Conditional edges allow for dynamic routing in the graph based on the current state, enabling more complex and interactive workflows.
